## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for showcasing diverse cybersecurity projects that highlight various technical skills and methodologies. The projects aim to facilitate learning and exploration in information security through hands-on examples and implementations.

## Projects

### 1. TCP Client and Server
This project demonstrates a basic client-server architecture utilizing the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It includes implementations for both the client and server, enabling message exchange over a network connection.

- **Key Features:**
  - Establishes a reliable TCP connection.
  - Supports bidirectional communication.

### 2. Nmap Scanner and Banner Grabber
This tool employs Nmap to scan networks and retrieve banners from services running on open ports. This project aids in identifying active services and assessing potential vulnerabilities.

- **Key Features:**
  - Performs comprehensive network scans.
  - Retrieves service banners for analysis.
